### Week 11 objectives:

* Review Week 10 topics on Docker, ECR, and foundational AWS container services.
* Practice packaging multi-service applications with Docker Compose and deploy containers on Lightsail Container Service.
* Learn CI/CD for containers, the Monolith to Microservices model, and deploy workloads on EKS/Fargate at a more advanced level.

### Week timeframe: **June 29–July 5, 2026**

### Tasks to be carried out this week:

| Day | Task | Start Date | Completion Date | Reference material |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Review Week 10 content on Docker, ECR, ECS, Fargate, and EKS. <br> **Docker Compose and multi-container applications:** <br>&emsp; + Write a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> for an app with frontend, API, and database. <br>&emsp; + Understand service dependencies, internal networking, volumes, and health checks locally. | June 29, 2026 | June 29, 2026 | <https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/4-modernize/><br><https://000015.awsstudygroup.com/> |
| 3 | **Amazon Lightsail Container Service:** <br>&emsp; + Create a Lightsail container service, push an image, and deploy a simple container on AWS. <br>&emsp; + Compare Lightsail Container with ECS/Fargate for operational complexity and cost on small workloads. | June 30, 2026 | June 30, 2026 | <https://000067.awsstudygroup.com/> |
| 4 | **Monolith to Microservices:** <br>&emsp; + Analyze how to split a monolith into microservices by bounded context. <br>&emsp; + Package each service as its own image and prepare registry and independent deploy configuration. | July 1, 2026 | July 2, 2026 | <https://cloudjourney.awsstudygroup.com/4-modernize/> |
| 5 | **CI/CD for containers:** <br>&emsp; + Learn pipelines to build images, push to ECR, and update deployment manifests. <br>&emsp; + Get familiar with GitHub Actions (or CodePipeline) for a basic build — scan — deploy flow. | July 3, 2026 | July 3, 2026 | <https://000126.awsstudygroup.com/> |
| 6 | **Advanced deployment on EKS/Fargate:** <br>&emsp; + Deploy core services with Deployment and Service on EKS; verify pods, replicas, and self-healing. <br>&emsp; + Monitor status with kubectl and CloudWatch; prepare groundwork for the project workshop. <br> **Post-lab cleanup:** <br>&emsp; + Remove Lightsail services, trial EKS/Fargate workloads, unused images, and review ECR to limit charges. | July 4, 2026 | July 5, 2026 | <https://000126.awsstudygroup.com/><br><https://000067.awsstudygroup.com/> |

### Week 11 achievements:

* Can use Docker Compose to run multi-service applications locally.

* Have hands-on experience deploying containers on Lightsail Container Service and comparing with ECS/Fargate.

* Understand the direction of splitting monoliths into microservices and packaging services independently.

* Grasp basic CI/CD for containers and deploy workloads on EKS/Fargate at a deeper level than Week 10.
